Microsoft was my first job out of college. I was pretty nervous coming into it. I really did not have much knowledge of how software was engineered in a large, team environment. I had gotten the job purely on my knowledge of Computer Science fundamentals and not any of the work that I had done previously. I didn't even really know what my role was going to be coming in. I was placed on a team which was developing Management Reporter for Microsoft Dynamics. This was pretty fortunate for me as it was a smaller team which controlled a lot about itself in comparison to the other teams in the division which were focused on one area of gigantic software. 

Management Reporter creates board-room quality financial reports using data it integrates from Microsoft's ERP systems (like AX, or GP). The application had a lot of parts. There was a desktop application for desiging reports (named very plainly Report Designer), there was a desktop application for viewing reports (similarly named Report Viewer), there was a web-based report viewer, many data integration parts (which would translate data from the ERP systems into either our own database schema which was efficient for making reports or by directly getting the data), and also server parts for computing and rendering the lines in the report.

Because the team controlled all of these systems, I was able to focus the majority of my time on the aspects I had the most interest in while still getting exposure to everything we were doing. In practice, this meant that I spent the majority of my time on the application side making improvements to the user interfaces and exposing new features.

I think the most useful thing I learned during my time at Microsoft was about software processes. I didn't know anything about how this worked before coming in and having a team in place that already knew the processes they liked meant that I could just learn about how tasks are tracked and triaged and coded and reviewed and tested. I gained a lot of good experience in these areas.

Ultimately, the team was transitioning to a new project and not scheduling a whole lot of work. I was still hungry to be creating a lot of things and I feel like the bureaucracy around the transition made me feel pretty stifled. That was a lot of my motivation for moving on.
