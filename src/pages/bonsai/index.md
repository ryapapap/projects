Bonsai is where I currently work as a software engineer focused on full stack development. I am creating APIs and interfaces to expose information about the AI agents. Things are constantly changing and improving. [Here’s a link to an agent](https://beta.bons.ai/ryan/cartpole). You can use that to see the current state of things. It’s a little different if you’re logged in and own the BRAIN, which you’ll hopefully be able to do soon.
