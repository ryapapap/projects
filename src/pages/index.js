    My name is Ryan. Iâ€™m based in the San Francisco Bay Area. I have worked as a software engineer on a wide range of applications including AI, healthcare, and financial reporting in web, mobile, desktop, and server contexts. I enjoy the craft in building software and the processes that enable teams to work in healthy ways.

    I am interested in the ways we relate to technology. Software is eating the world. Itâ€™s eating us too. We canâ€™t separate the messiness of our lives from the ways we use technology. I want to understand how we improve who we are and how we relate to each other on deeper levels. I wonder if software could help.

    To this end, Iâ€™m trying to craft expressions of care and understand the structure and expression of our ideas. Iâ€™m experimenting in digital and irl ways. Soon, I hope, Iâ€™ll have a better way of sharing all those things, but for now, hereâ€™s a few links to some seedlings:
