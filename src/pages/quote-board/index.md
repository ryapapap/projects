I'm not linking directly to this project because I'm not confident it'll keep working in the future. I scraped some image URLs from [Bing's daily image](http://www.bing.com/gallery/) and I think it's from an expiring domain, so there's a good chance the backgrounds won't load in. In addition, I don't have a strong attachment to the quotes. I thought I had a long list of quotes that I really liked, but it turns out I didn't have many and they were all too long, so I just found a list online I could copy out.

This was a project I started after waking up in the middle of the night with no hope of falling back asleep, so it's just a small amount of hacking done on it.
