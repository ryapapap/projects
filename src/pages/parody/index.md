Alright, I'm not linking directly to this project. This is because it makes me cringe a bit. It also makes me laugh though, which is why I'm ultimately putting it here.

I came up with this after I saw someone talking about themself as a brand in a very serious way. I thought it was kind of funny that people think like that. I'm not trying to say that having a 'brand' is bad, but it seems kinda silly to focus on being a brand over being useful.

OK, that's enough rambling.
